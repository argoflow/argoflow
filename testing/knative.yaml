                      may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this
                      time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted

                      termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that
                      30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal
                      (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod
                      from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object
                      may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator
                      or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated.

                      is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion
                      is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may
                      not be unset or be set further into the future, although it
                      may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this
                      time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted
                      in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful
                      termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that
                      30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal
                      (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod
                      from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object
                      may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator
                      or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated.
                      If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.  Populated
                      by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only.

                      can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order,

                      for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal
                      (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component
                      responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in
                      a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to
                      order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering

    #   * Revisions which are referenced by a Route are considered active.

    #      "knative.dev/no-gc":"true" to be permanently considered active.
    #   * Active revisions are not considered for GC.
    # Retention
    #   * Revisions are retained if they are any of the following:
    #       1. Active
    #       2. Were created within "retain-since-create-time"
    #       3. Were last referenced by a route within
    #           "retain-since-last-active-time"
    #       4. There are fewer than "min-non-active-revisions"
    #     If none of these conditions are met, or if the count of revisions exceed
